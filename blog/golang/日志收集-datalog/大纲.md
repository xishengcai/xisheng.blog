## autodiscovery

该包负责从不同的源收集检查配置，

```
# package `autodiscovery`

This package is a core piece of the agent. It is responsible for collecting check configurations from different sources (see package [config providers](https://logs-agent/tree/master/pkg/autodiscovery/providers)) and then schedule or unschedule integration configurations with the help of the schedulers.

It is also responsible for listening to container-related events and resolve template configurations that would match them.

## `AutoConfig`

As a central component, `AutoConfig` owns and orchestrates several key modules:

- it owns a reference to a [`MetaScheduler`](https://logs-agent/blob/master/pkg/autodiscovery/scheduler) that dispatches integrations configs for scheduling or unscheduling to all registered schedulers. There are 3 scheduler implementations: checks scheduler and logs scheduler in the agent, and cluster checks dispatcher in the cluster agent.
- it stores a list of [`ConfigProviders`](https://logs-agent/blob/master/pkg/autodiscovery/providers) and poll them according to their poll policy via [`configPollers`](https://logs-agent/blob/master/pkg/autodiscovery/config_poller.go)
- it owns [`ServiceListener`](https://logs-agent/blob/master/pkg/autodiscovery/listeners) used to listen to lifecycle events of containers and other kind of services like network devices, kubernetes Endpoints and Service objects
- it uses the `ConfigResolver` that resolves a configuration template to an actual configuration based on a service matching the template. A template matches a service if they have in common at least one AD identifier element
- it uses a `store` component to safely store and retrieve all data and mappings needed for the autodiscovery lifecycle

- 包介绍

这个包实现了错误重试机制，能够嵌入到任意一个需要错误尝试的系统类中。

它足够灵活地支持任何公开func() err 方法的进程，并且可以扩张到其他重试策略，而不是默认的策略

- 支持的策略
  - 不重试：第一个错误时失败
  - 重试计数：
  - 回滚
